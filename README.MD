# Advent of Code 2024 - Rust Solutions ðŸŽ„

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, implemented in **Rust**. Advent of Code is a yearly programming event with daily challenges leading up to Christmas, designed to enhance your problem-solving skills in a fun and festive way.

## About the Project

Advent of Code provides a variety of algorithmic challenges, ranging from string parsing to complex graph traversal. This repository is a personal journey to solve all 25 days of the event in **Rust**, improving my knowledge of:
- File I/O
- Iterators and closures
- Error handling
- Performance optimizations

## Why Rust?

Rust is an ideal language for Advent of Code because:
- **Performance**: Solves problems quickly, even with large datasets.
- **Memory Safety**: Eliminates common bugs like null pointer dereferencing or buffer overflows.
- **Expressive Syntax**: Great for functional and procedural patterns.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)
- A text editor or IDE with Rust support (e.g., NeoVim, VSCode, or IntelliJ IDEA with Rust plugin).

To confirm Rust is installed:
```bash
rustc --version
